Alright this is the source of the small demo that I showed at the google hackfest at Railsconf 2010.

The files you really want to look at are "public/index.html", and the "posts_controller.rb".

I don't actually remember the process it took to set my entire ruby environment to actually run the server
BUUUT.. you should just ask John "Woody" Woodell (@JohnWoodell) because he's a great guy and more than
willing to help you get set up. I do consider myself more of a javascript and ruby guy so if you have any
questions related to that you can go ahead and hit me up @jacortinas.

Thanks
